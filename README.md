# workScripts
In this repo you will find:

folderAutomation.py: A script that watches a share folder for recent files added or changed, and then sends a message to a Slack group, you will need Watchdog for the script

dailyChatReminder.py: A script that sends a message to a slack chat channel daily (mostly put here for sharing)

time.py: A script that can be used to automate time entry into Coreform, you will need Selenium and Chromedriver for the script



Note: for task scheduler, I have found it easier to create a batch file to call the script and enter CMD arguments
